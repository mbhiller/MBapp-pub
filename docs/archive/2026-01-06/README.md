# Archived Documentation (2026-01-06)

This directory contains all documentation that is **no longer actively maintained** as part of the canonical documentation set.

## Canonical Docs (SSOT)

The following **5 documents are the canonical source of truth** for MBapp:

- [MBapp-Roadmap.md](../../MBapp-Roadmap.md) — Feature roadmap, tiers, and delivery phases
- [MBapp-Foundations.md](../../MBapp-Foundations.md) — Structural standards, object model, API patterns, UI/mobile conventions
- [MBapp-Status.md](../../MBapp-Status.md) — Current implementation status, sprint summaries, recent changes
- [MBapp-Cadence.md](../../MBapp-Cadence.md) — Workflow cadence, Definition of Done, testing rules
- [smoke-coverage.md](../../smoke-coverage.md) — Smoke test organization, commands, coverage tiers

## Why We Archived

As the codebase matured, we consolidated scattered documentation into a smaller, more maintainable set of canonical docs. Archived docs may be stale, incomplete, or contradictory to the canonical set.

## How to Use Archive

- **Do not cite archived docs as truth.** They are reference-only.
- **If you find useful information in an archived doc**, copy the relevant content forward into a canonical doc (update it if needed), rather than linking to the archive.
- **Example:** If `MBapp-Backend-Guide.md` documents a pattern that is still valid but missing from `MBapp-Foundations.md`, extract the pattern and merge it into `MBapp-Foundations.md` with a proper update.
