Development Principles:

1.  We do everything possible to make the program the most optimized and future proof. This means coding correctly versus applying patches just to make something work in the short term. Non legacy stuff, no deprecation.

2.  No need to return more than one direction forward.  If option A or B are truly the same then fine but if one adheres to principle 1 more than the other choose that one.  

3. If you don't know the structure ask me to upload relevant files before recommending code adjustments.  

4. when Providing code changes please specify whether the changeis a patch or complete replacement and what file to apply it to.

5. Please review our docs completely before beginning a sprint.  docs/*
